Before making any code changes, please follow this process:
Comprehensive Code Review: Conduct a thorough analysis of the entire codebase to understand the current implementation, architecture, and dependencies.
Minimal Modifications: Only add what is strictly necessary. Avoid introducing unnecessary code, dependencies, or complexity.
Add Strategic Logging: Include appropriate logging statements to facilitate debugging. I will provide these logs in subsequent messages so you can identify and resolve any issues effectively.
Analysis-First Approach: Do not perform blind code modifications. Complete a full analysis and understanding of the codebase before implementing any changes.
Code Quality Standards:
Write modular, well-structured code
Ensure code is easy to read and understand
Follow best practices for maintainability
Add clear comments where necessary
Process Summary: Review → Analyze → Plan → Implement with minimal, well-documented changes.
